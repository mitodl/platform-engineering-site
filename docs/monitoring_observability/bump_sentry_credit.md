# How To Bump Our Sentry Credits When We Run Out

Sometimes despite our best efforts, one of our projects spirals out of control
and generates a HUGE number of events which can overrun our Sentry quota and
cause errors to get dropped.

The way to both review our status, check dropped events AND boost our quota is
to surf to the [Sentry URL for MIT
OL](https://mit-office-of-digital-learning.sentry.io) and navigate to Settings
-> Subscription.

Once there you can see all our current stats including current usage, quota
percentage and dropped events/errors if any.

Use the "Edit" button to increase our quota if necessary to get us through the
month AFTER addressing whichever product is causing the overage.
