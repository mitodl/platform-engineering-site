attribute, in this case the tags that we're specifying the S3 bucket should have in our Pulumi source disagrees with what's actually sitting out there on EC2.</p> <p>In order to fix this discrepancy,

So you guys can know too.</p> <ol> <li>I updated / tested a bunch of stacks, mostly CI or sometimes QA, yesterday with the <code>pulumi-aws 6.5.0</code> upgrade. That is a two part thing. Python package but also provider.</li> <li>Part of that upgrade, pulumi changed some of the state/stack structures and they are no longer backwards compatible, in particular those around RDS instances.</li> <li>So I, by hand, upgraded a bunch of stacks to the new provider, they migrate nicely everything is good.</li> <li>Concourse comes around and something triggers it and it applies the stacks again but with the old provider. It works okay the first time, but when the second time comes around it decides it has lost track of the RDS instance and it tries to recreate it.</li> <li>If it DOES try to recreate it, thankfully it fails, because the RDS instance is still there, just pulumi has lost it, and a duplicate error gets thrown and the apply/up fails.</li> <li>But, now the stack is broken and requires manual intervention to revive it.<ul> <li>So what I do is I go into the history/checkpoint area in S3 and find the most recent checkpoint that references the 6.5.0 provider (the one I upgraded to). I pull that down.</li> <li>Checkpoints can\u2019t be imported directly they need to be fixed. Fix it with this: https://gist.github.com/clstokes/977b7bd00b37e0a564f707f0ebe36e08</li> <li><code>pr pulumi stack import -s &lt;stackname&gt; --file &lt;fixed stack checkpoint file&gt;</code></li> <li><code>poetry install</code> using an environment pre-6.5.0 upgrade if necessary (I keep multiple ol-inf envs for exactly this kind of thing so I just switch between my 5.4 and 6.5 envs).</li> <li><code>pulumi plugin rm resource aws 6.5.0</code> uninstall the PROVIDER</li> <li><code>pr pulumi up --refresh -s &lt;stackname&gt;</code> x2 \u2014 Shouldn\u2019t be trying to create a database anymore.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Many of the stacks were fine because they either:<ul> <li>didn\u2019t have RDS resources</li> <li>didn\u2019t get up\u2019d by concourse inbetween.</li> </ul> </li> <li>BUT! BUT! When the PR making this upgrade was merged to <code>main</code> , it trigged nearly everything. Very sad. :disappointed:<ul> <li>But the code has been merged so that is fine right? Wrong.</li> <li>The resources that concourse uses to do the needful are not upgraded yet. Specifically these:<ul> <li>https://hub.docker.com/r/mitodl/concourse-pulumi-resource-provisioner</li> <li>https://hub.docker.com/r/mitodl/concourse-pulumi-resource</li> <li>https://hub.docker.com/r/mitodl/ol-infrastructure</li> </ul> </li> <li>These actually have a complicated silent depedency between them, but basically <code>mitodl/ol-infrastructure</code> is a base layer for the other two.</li> <li>These builds also kicked off (maybe? I did run them by hand too\u2026) when the PR was merged but they didn\u2019t publish to dockerhub before concourse started trying to update CI/QA stacks automatically.<ul> <li>EVEN IF they had published to dockerhub before, it wouldn\u2019t matter because servers-be-cachin\u2019.</li> <li>The concourse workers were holding on to their old versions and efficiently re-using them, ignorant of the new versions available out on dockerhub.</li> <li>Solve this by doing and instance refresh on concourse workers. New servers do new <code>docker pull</code> on the resources needed.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> </li> <li>Addendum: Made a neat script to pause concourse pipelines en-mass.

This is just a json file local to the machine running the packer build (not the remote ec2 build instance as before). Because this is the first <code>post-processor</code> and follows the last <code>provisioner</code> step, the remote EC2 instance has been terminated and an AMI has been generated.

Understanding these guidelines will ensure a positive experience for both instructors and learners.</p> <p>1. Capabilities:</p> <ul> <li>Notebook Execution Environment: Learners can execute notebooks authored by     instructors within a pre-configured computational environment. This allows hands-on     practice with programming concepts, data analysis, and AI tools.</li> <li>Instructor Notebook Authoring: Instructors can create and upload Jupyter     Notebooks for use in their courses. Please ensure notebooks are well-documented and     designed for learner engagement.  Notebook authoring is managed through MIT\u2019s     enterprise GitHub repository:     github.mit.edu/ol-notebooks. All changes     must be submitted as pull requests, requiring approval from the Open Learning     engineering team.</li> <li>Shared Environment: All learners share the same base environment. This     simplifies management but limits customization options (see Limitations).</li> </ul> <p>2. Limitations &amp; Resource Management:</p> <p>This JupyterHub instance is running on a shared Kubernetes cluster, requiring resource constraints to maintain stability and fairness for all users. The following limitations are in place:</p> <ul> <li>Resource Limits per Notebook: Each notebook execution has the following resource     limits:<ul> <li>CPU: 1 vCPU (core)</li> <li>Memory: 2 GB RAM</li> <li>Disk Space: 500 MB temporary storage. This is not persistent and will be     cleared upon notebook termination.</li> </ul> </li> <li>GPU Resources: Limited GPU hardware is available for ML/AI focused     notebooks. These are not frontier-grade chips, so capacity is constrained.</li> <li>Generative AI Workloads: For workloads involving generative AI models (e.g.,     large language model inference), it's strongly recommended to leverage managed     service APIs such as OpenAI or Hugging Face Inference endpoints instead of running     models directly within the JupyterHub environment. This will provide more reliable     performance and scalability.</li> <li>No Persistent Workspaces: Currently, there are no persistent learner     workspaces. Any changes made within a notebook (e.g., file creation, data     modification) will be lost when the notebook server terminates. Learners should     download any necessary results or artifacts before closing their browser     tab/notebook. This is a deliberate design choice to manage resource consumption and     simplify infrastructure management.</li> <li>Session Timeout: Inactive notebooks will automatically terminate after 30     minutes. This helps reclaim resources.</li> <li>Kernel Limits: Each notebook can only have one kernel running at any given time.</li> </ul> <p>3. Operational Expectations &amp; Support:</p> <p>As the platform operator, I am responsible for maintaining the stability and performance of JupyterHub. To facilitate this:</p> <ul> <li>Responsible Notebook Usage: Instructors are encouraged to design notebooks that     are efficient in terms of resource consumption. Avoid computationally intensive     tasks or large data downloads within a single notebook if possible.</li> <li>Reporting Issues: Please report any unexpected behavior, errors, or performance     issues through mitlearn-support@mit.edu. Include details about the notebook     involved and steps to reproduce the issue.</li> <li>No Direct Infrastructure Access: Instructors will not be granted direct access     to the underlying Kubernetes cluster or JupyterHub infrastructure. All requests for     changes or customizations must go through mitlearn-support@mit.edu.</li> <li>Maintenance Windows: Periodic maintenance windows may occur, during which     JupyterHub availability may be temporarily impacted. Advance notice will be provided     whenever possible.</li> </ul> <p>4. Future Considerations (Potential Enhancements):</p> <p>We are exploring options to enhance the JupyterHub environment in the future, including:</p> <ul> <li>Persistent Learner Workspaces: Providing learners with persistent storage for     their notebooks and data. This would require significant infrastructure investment     and changes to our operational procedures.</li> <li>Customizable Environments: Allowing instructors (and potentially learners) to     select different base environments or install additional packages.</li> </ul> <p>IMPORTANT NOTES &amp; CONSIDERATIONS:</p> <ul> <li>Kubernetes Context is Key: The resource limits are absolute. Instructors need     to understand that exceeding these limits will result in notebook termination and     potential disruption for other users.</li> <li>Communication is Crucial: This document should be prominently displayed within     your course materials. Proactive communication about the limitations can prevent     frustration and misunderstandings among learners.</li> <li>Monitoring &amp; Adjustment: I\u2019ll be monitoring resource usage closely. These limits     may need to be adjusted based on actual load and performance. Instructors will be     notified of any significant changes.</li> <li>Security: Remind instructors that this is a shared environment, and they should     not store sensitive data within notebooks or upload potentially malicious code.</li> <li>GitHub Workflow: Ensure all instructors are familiar with the pull request     workflow for contributing to the <code>ol-notebooks</code> repository.</li> <li>Feedback Loop: I\u2019m open to feedback on these guidelines. Your input can help us     improve the JupyterHub experience for everyone.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"platform_services/container_orchestration/deploying_apps_with_kubernetes/","title":"Deploying an Application at MIT Open Learning with Kubernetes","text":""},{"location":"platform_services/container_orchestration/deploying_apps_with_kubernetes/#assumptions","title":"Assumptions","text":"<ul> <li>You'll be deploying an app that includes a helm chart.</li> <li>You've installed helm and kubectl.</li> <li>You plan to manage your Kubernetes app's infra and deployment with Pulumi.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"platform_services/container_orchestration/deploying_apps_with_kubernetes/#questions","title":"Questions","text":"<ul> <li>Will you need to create a new Kubernetes cluster along with this new application you're deploying?

It is possible for containers to communicate with their peer containers in a task group over localhost connections, but since DNS is a privileged process it is not straightforward to force those queries to rely on a sidecar in the grouping.

You can do this by logging into Hubspot,</p> <p>You can do this using the username/password and TOTP token found in [Vault](https://vault-production.odl.mit.edu/ui/vault/secrets/platform-secrets/kv/hubspot/details?version=1.</p> <p>Once you're logged in, click \"Open\" next to \"MIT XPro\" in the Accounts list.</p> <p>Then, click on the gear icon in the upper right corner of the page and select \"Integrations\" -&gt; \"Private Apps\" in the sidebar on the left.</p> <p>You should then see the XPRo private app and beneath that a link for \"View Access Token\". Click that, then click on the \"Manage Token\" link.</p> <p>On this screen, you should see a \"Rotate\" button, click that to generate a new API key.</p> <p>Now that you've generated your new API token, you'll need to get that token into Vault using SOPS. You can find the right secrets file for this in Github here.</p> <p>The process for deploying secrets deserves its own document, so after adding the new API token to the SOPS decrypted secrets file you just generated, commit it to Github, ensure it runs through the appropriate pipelines and ends up in Vault.</p> <p>You can find the ultimate home of the XPro Hubspot API key in Vault here.</p> <p>Once the new API token is in the correct spot, you'll need to ensure that new token gets deployed to production in Heroku by tracking its progress in this pipeline.</p> <p>You will likely need to close Concourse Github workflow issues to make this happen. See its users guide for details.</p> <p>Once that's complete, you should have mitigated this issue. Keep checking that Sentry page to ensure that the Last Seen value reflects something appropriately long ago and you can resolve this ticket.</p> <p>If you are asked to run a sync to Hubspot: - Inform the requester, preferably on the #product-xpro Slack that the process will take quite a long time. If this is time critical they may ask you to run only parts of the sync. You can find documentation on the command you'll run here.</p> <p>Since XPro runs on Heroku, you'll need to get a Heroku console shell to run the management command. You can get to that shell by logging into heroku with the Heroku CLI and running:</p> <pre><code>heroku run /bin/bash -a xpro-production\n</code></pre> <p>It takes a while but you will eventually get your shell prompt.</p> <p>From there, run the following commands. To sync all variants:</p> <pre><code>./manage.py sync_db_to_hubspot create\n</code></pre> <p>If you're asked to run only one, for example deals, you can consult the documentation linked above and see that you should add the <code>--deals</code> flag to the invocation.</p> <p>Be sure to inform the requester of what you see for output and add it to the ticket for this issue if there is one.</p> <p>If you see the command fail with an exception, note the HTTP response code. In particular a 401 means that the API key is likely out of date.
